      THE TEAM
    </h2>

    <div class="about-paragraph">
      We are a club team of mostly undergraduates (but some grad students too!) at the University of Pennsylvania who love to ski, snowboard, and have a blast on the slopes! If you enjoy being on the mountain, you'll love being a part of our group. 
    </div>
    <div class="about-paragraph">
      While there's a lot of team interaction regardless of the time of year, our season centers on five to six weekend trips typically beginning in early January and culminating in mid to late February (<a href="season.html">see the race schedule</a>). We leave on Friday afternoons and return to Penn on Sunday evenings. Our weekends are spent racing and free skiing with other East coast schools at mountains in NY, NJ, and PA as a part of the <a href="https://www.uscsa.com/atlantic_highlands.html">USCSA Atlantic Highlands Conference</a>. 
    </div>
    <div class="about-paragraph">
      As a competitive team we race and participate in freestyle events with passion, but we do not require our team members to have prior racing experience. As long as you know how to ski or snowboard, you're good to go! That said, we require that each team member to give competing a shot at least once, and we consistently find that our new members have a lot of fun doing it. 
    </div>
    <div class="about-paragraph">
      If you have any questions, please check the FAQ below, send us an email, or reach out to one of our officers. Hope to find you where the snow is!
    </div>


    <h2 class="about-header">
      HOW TO JOIN
    </h2>
    <div class="about-paragraph">
      Joining is easy - members become official after paying team dues and signing a few waivers for our school and our conference. Registration occurs once a year during the fall semester in the months of September and October. 
    </div>
    <div class="about-paragraph">
      Make sure to come out to the fall activities fair or our info session and get your email on our preliminary listserv for full information about the registration process! If you can't make it to the info session but would like to receive details about joining, please send us an <a href="mailto:ctwfox@seas.upenn.edu">email.</a>

            Absolutely. Our team accepts all ability levels, provided that you have basic skiing or snowboarding experience and are able to navigate the mountain on your own. Most team members have little to no competitive race experience, while some are veterans from their high school team or USSA / FIS racing.

            Being a team member entitles you to attend all team events on campus for free and gives you access to all race weekend signups. Team dues also go towards USCSA NJ Conference dues and USCSA National dues. On weekends you attend, the team covers:

            <ul>
              <li>- Round trip transportation (gas and toll costs)</li>
              <li>- Lift tickets</li>
              <li>- Racer registration fees</li>
              <li>- Lodging for the weekend</li>
            </ul>
             
            Most importantly, being on the team means interacting with a welcoming group of like-minded but diverse students looking to share an amazing athletic and social experience.

            The commitment level is entirely up to you! Some of our members are super committed and attend every weekend and event on campus. Others love to ski too, but only have time to come occasionally. You are not required to attend anything after joining the team.

            Carpools, typically around 6 people, leave from campus on Friday afternoons/evenings for the mountain. Details are sent out beforehand, and then cars leave at various times to accomodate team members' schedules. Some students drive their own cars, while others drive rental vans after completing the University driving safety course.
            <br><br>  
            After arrival, the team stays together at a hotel or motel near the mountain on Friday and Saturday nights.
            <br><br>
            Cars leave directly from the mountain on Sunday afternoons to return to Penn as soon as possible, typically arriving in the early evening.

            Being a dues-paying member of the team entitles you to attend all team events on campus (team socials, extreme skiing movie screenings, etc.) for free. However, race weekend signups and other off campus events are limited to a certain number of people based on capacity (usually around 30 for weekends), and as a result there is a possibility of being waitlisted. If you are unable to attend a weekend due to overcapacity, you will be given priority on the next weekend for which you sign up. In reality, team members seldom are waitlisted or unable to come on a weekend.
            <br><br>  
            Once paid, team dues are not refundable.
            <br><br>  
            The team does not supply skiing equipment, but we are happy to help you find the best rental options if you don't own ski gear.
