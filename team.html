          JUSTIN SWIRBUL
        </div>

        <div class="officer-description">
          Justin is a senior studying computer science, except he’s really chill about that and probably only likes coding because he thinks it’s artsy. Mr. President is known as the jack of all trades and the only time you could ever find this angel getting in trouble is when he sneaks himself into both the racing and freestyle competitions. Justin is chill vibes only unless he’s fending off law enforcement and even then he is probably humming his indie alternative songs while eating some more sugar. Justin goes down fast, without ever wearing any jackets.

          CHRIS FOX
        </div>

        <div class="officer-description">
          Chris Fox is the spiciest MEAM junior. He got elected as Vice President because he speaks for the “race car and mechanical engineering” population of the team which is a good 70%. Ski weekends are probably the only time he isn’t sleeping in the engineering buildings. We would consider Chris to be a pretty sendy guy, but his true claim to fame is finding every dollar general store in upstate New York to find more liquid smarties to down before he sends a flip or something. Stay foxy, chris.

          Alexa “I skied at boarding school” Murray can tell you that she’s definitely the most athletic member of the team since she’s a 3 sPoRt aThLEte. She’s a Senior studying ESE, meaning this is her final year leading the women’s alpine team to victory because we actually do win that event. She warns,

          Kim “I also skied at boarding school” Almesberg is a Senior studying Biology. Kim may be a mystery to you because she was out all of last season. You can ask Chris Fox how exactly he gave her a concussion.

        <div class="officer-description">
          Emmie Gocke is a Junior and is premed studying Biology. This makes sense because she’s the most in touch with nature skier on the mountai, and is from a state that isn’t even real, Wyoming.  Sometimes gluten free beverages inspire her to crowd surf, but most of the time she is landing a double twisty cork screw disaster turny.

          Sarah Engelhardt is a Senior studying Chemical and Bimolecular Engineering. If you see someone on the mountain wearing braided pink tails tucked into a helmet it is likely Sarah. She has recently grown an extra inch that has graduated her into the world of adult skis. She dreams of a world where fairies and magical butterflies rule the mountain.

          Sarah Klein is a Sophomore studying Mathematical Econ. She is a pretty chill skier on the mountain, especially because of her Swedish origins, she helps represent the needs of the Europeans on our team as an officer. As secretary she tries to keep it neutral. She originally joined the team as a spy to see how American skiers go down but stuck around when she realized we ski faster than the Sweds.

If she’s not screaming “Last Nights Mascara” in Chris Fox’s truck while having a laugh attack, she’s probably having a laugh attack after getting wrecked on a rail instead. She went to Nationals her first year AND claims she’s the best auxer on the mountain, we think it’s a hit or miss. Ski with her and you will quickly here about whose outfits she thinks are the steeziest.
